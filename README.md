# **AdminCommandBlocker v1.0**

A **Minecraft security plugin** that blocks specific commands. **Even players with OP or all permissions cannot use the blocked commands** unless they are added to the plugin‚Äôs whitelist.

---

## **Features**
- Permission-insensitive command blocking (blocks commands even for OP players).
- Built-in whitelist management.
- Easy configuration via `config.yml`.
- Prevents the plugin from being disabled with plugins like PlugMan.  

---

## **Installation**
1. Place the `AdminCommandBlocker-1.0.jar` file into your server‚Äôs `plugins` folder.
2. Start or restart your server to generate the default `config.yml`.
3. Edit `config.yml` to configure blocked commands and whitelist.
4. Ensure `/acb reload` permission (`admincommandblocker.reload`) is granted to allowed users.
